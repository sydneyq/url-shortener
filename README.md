# URL Shortener
Based off of the [Digital Ocean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-url-shortener-with-django-and-graphql), made July 18th, 2020.

### Tools
* Python3
* Django
* GraphQL
### Local access
* GraphQL web interface: http://localhost:8000/graphql/
* Shortened URLs: http://localhost:8000/url_hash
### Notes
* When on MacOS X, don't use `apt`, use `brew`, if an ["unable to locate executable"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37493562/apt-install-unable-to-locate-executable) error exists. 
* [Need to set up Python3, Pip3, or VirtualEnv on a Mac or Ubuntu?](https://gist.github.com/inadarei/f15449b78d53feaae415a0bcc8da3fc9)
